## Minesweeper Game

### # React + TypeScript + Vite

### Game Description:

Create a Minesweeper game where the player uncovers tiles on a grid, trying to avoid hidden mines. The game involves revealing tiles, marking potential mine locations, and using logic to navigate the grid without triggering mines.

### Features:

- Generate a grid of tiles with hidden mines.
- Allow the player to reveal tiles.
- Implement logic for calculating and displaying numbers on tiles indicating nearby mines.
- Allow the player to mark potential mine locations.
- Implement game logic for uncovering tiles and determining game outcomes.
- Keep track of the player's score and time.
- Display a congratulations screen upon winning or a game over screen upon losing.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

#### Technologies:

- React with TypeScript for the frontend.
- StyleX, FramerMotion, CSS for styling.
- Use functional components and hooks.
- Component-based architecture.

#### Steps to Build:

- Y: Set up a new React project with TypeScript.
- Y: Create a component to generate the Minesweeper grid.
- Y: Implement logic for placing mines randomly on the grid.
- Y : Calculate and display numbers on tiles indicating nearby mines.
- Y : Allow the player to reveal tiles and mark potential mines.
- : Remove left click on node , then
- ? : Implement game logic for uncovering tiles and determining game outcomes.
- Track and display the player's score and time.
- Display a congratulations or game over screen.
- Allow the player to start a new game.

#### Challenges:

- Managing game state and transitions between game phases.
- Implementing logic for mine placement and tile revealing.
- Handling user input for revealing tiles and marking mines.
- Calculating numbers on tiles based on nearby mines.
- This project offers a chance to practice state management, algorithmic problem-solving, and user interactions.
